# 📺 Viewership Data Analysis

This analysis was created to examine how customers interact with video content across different platforms. The goal is to understand user behaviour, identify trends in watch time, and highlight which content and platforms drive the most engagement.

# 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis project based on viewership activity. The dataset includes information about when users watched content, how long they watched for, the platforms used, and the types of events recorded.
The purpose of this analysis is to uncover behavioural patterns, measure platform performance, and provide actionable insights for content and platform strategy.

# 📐 Data Dimensions (Breakdowns)

The dataset is explored across several meaningful dimensions:

## 📅 Date of Activity

Shows how engagement trends shift over time.

## 👤 Customer Behaviour

Unique customer activity, repeat interactions, and viewing habits.

## 🖥️ Platform Usage

Performance of each platform based on total time watched and frequency of use.

## ▶️ Play Event Type

Distribution of different event types (e.g., plays, pauses, etc.).

## 🎬 Video Title

Identifies top-performing content based on watch counts and popularity.

# ⏱️ Watch Time

Analysis of minimum, maximum, and total time watched across the dataset.

# 🔍 Key Findings & Insights
1. Platform Performance

Some platforms dominate viewership activity both in volume and in average watch time.
This indicates a strong user preference and highlights where improvements will have the largest impact.

2. Content Popularity

A small group of video titles consistently receives higher engagement than others.
This suggests clear user interest patterns and an opportunity to promote or invest in similar content types.

3. Watch Time Behaviour

Watch durations vary widely, with notable differences across users and platforms.
Identifying these patterns helps in planning content length and improving session retention.

4. Play Event Distribution

Certain event types occur far more frequently than others, revealing how viewers interact with content.
This can inform user experience improvements and interface optimizations.

5. User Diversity

There is a wide range of unique customers, each interacting with content differently.
Understanding this diversity helps in segmenting users for personalised recommendations.

# 💡 Recommendations
Enhance the Strongest Platform

Users naturally gravitate towards one or two platforms.
Investing in performance, UI improvements, and feature enhancements on these platforms will yield immediate gains.

Leverage High-Performing Content

Top titles reveal what users truly enjoy.
Promote similar videos, create themed collections, or invest in comparable content to maximise engagement.

Improve User Retention

If watch times are short on certain platforms or content types, optimise video presentation, add auto-play features, or improve content discovery tools.

Expand Content Variety

Where engagement is low, introduce new genres, refine recommendations, or adjust content length to better match viewer habits.
